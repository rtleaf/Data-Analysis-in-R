Email: robert.leaf@usm.edu Phone: 2-4296 Course Meeting Day and Time: MW, 2:30 to 3:45 PM Course Meeting Location: Caylor Computer Lab and Zoom 1.2 Course Description and Objectives This course examines the fundamental concepts and techniques for programming in the R statistical programming language. I am convinced that data analysis, data manipulation, data visualization, and reproducible research necessitates command of quantitative tools. Although there are many specialized and general programming languages, the R programming language offers exceptional utility for analysis and is used widely in academia, industry, and by federal and state scientific groups. The demand for skilled data analysis practitioners is rapidly growing and this course prepares you to tackle real-world data analysis challenges. The primary components of the course: Introduce the basics of R programming The course will introduce stereotypical programming concepts, in particular code modularisation, writing and using functions, and code re-usability. We will focus on understanding software engineering concepts such as project build and code testing. Participants will establish a working knowledge of R, R Studio, and relevant packages Review aspects of project organization A typical data analysis project involves several many components, each including several data files and different binary scripts with code. Keeping these files organized can be challenging and requires a suite of analytical tools. Perform operations on vectors and understand how to use advanced functions Learn how to wrangle, analyze and visualize data using base R operations and specialized packages (e.g. tidyverse and ggplot2) Promote a reproducible research workflow Finally, we will examine how to write markdown documents for high throughput data presentation which permits you to incorporate text and code into a document. 1.3 At the conclusion of this course: Students will be able to recognize problems that can be solved using statistical programming and reproducible research approaches. The skills of sharing, automation, and organization enable making research more reproducible. By practicing and reinforcing the use of quantitative tools, participants will be better able to make insights that would otherwise be hidden. 1.4 Course Materials R for Data Science by G.

Our goals are to continue our in-person classes, hold events and activities on campus, and provide support to those in the community to weather the challenges we are facing. Face-to-Face Protocol - We want everyone to follow the Universitys complete Community Standards, which are updated as needed based on changing patterns with the virus. Face coverings are required for all indoor activities, regardless of your vaccination status, and we ask that you monitor yourself for fever and other symptoms each day. Temperature-taking kiosks can be found in the Union, Cochran Center, and other high-traffic areas of our campuses for your convenience. Vaccinations - If you have not yet been fully vaccinated, appointments can be made via Moffitt Health Centers online health portal. If you prefer to schedule an appointment off-campus, please see the Mississippi Department of Healths website. Please note that if it has been more than six months since your last shot, you must have a booster in order to be up-to-date with vaccination. If You Are Exposed to COVID-19/Have Symptoms/Test Positive - It is important that everyone in the community closely monitor their own health and stay home when that will help them heal or may protect others. For Vaccinated students: If you are exposed to COVID-19 and have no symptoms, wear a mask at all times and test five days after exposure. If your test is negative, continue as normal. If you have a positive COVID test, stay home for five additional days then return as long as you do not have symptoms (e.g., fever). If you have symptoms, stay home until your symptoms pass. For Unvaccinated students: If you are exposed to COVID-19, stay home and test 5 days after exposure. If you have a positive COVID test, stay home for ten days (or as advised by your physician, based on symptoms), then return as long as you do not have symptoms (e.g., fever). If you need to stay home due to COVID-19: Contact the Dean of Students office to let them know (dos@usm.edu), and contact all your professors to let them know you will be out. In all cases: Call Moffit Health Center at 601-266-5390 for further guidance. 1.14 Nondiscrimination Statement The University of Southern Mississippi offers to all persons equal access to educational, programmatic and employment opportunities without regard to age, sex, sexual orientation, disability, pregnancy, gender identity, genetic information, religion, race, color, national origin, and/or veteran status pursuant to applicable state and federal law. 1.15 Confidentiality and Mandatory Reporting As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create and maintain a safe learning environment.  I have a mandatory reporting responsibility related to my role as a faculty member.  I am required to share information regarding sexual misconduct or information about a crime that may have occurred on USMs campus with certain University officials responsible for the investigation and remediation of sexual misconduct. The information will remain private and will only be shared with those officials necessary to resolve the matter.  If you would like to speak in confidence, resources available to students include Confidential Advisors with the Shafer Center for Crisis Intervention, the Counseling Center, and Student Health Services.  More information on these resources and University Policies is available at https://www.usm.edu/sexual-misconduct. 1.16 Academic Integrity All students at the University of Southern Mississippi are expected to demonstrate the highest levels of academic integrity. Forms of academic dishonesty include cheating (including copying from others work), plagiarism (representing another persons words or ideas as your own; failure to properly cite the source of your information, argument, or concepts), falsification of documents, disclosure of or use of test material or other assignment content to another student, submission of the same paper or other assignment to more than one class without the explicit approval of all faculty members involved, unauthorized academic collaboration with others, conspiracy to engage in academic misconduct. Engaging in any of these behaviors or supporting others who do so will result in academic penalties and/or other sanctions. If a faculty member determines that a student has violated our Academic Integrity Policy, sanctions ranging from resubmission of work to course failure may occur, including the possibility of receiving a grade of XF for the course, which will be on the students transcript with the notation Failure due to academic misconduct. 1.17 Content of this online material.

Click on the Download R for (Mac) OS X link at the top of the page. Click on the file containing the latest version of R under Files. Save the .pkg file, double-click it to open, and follow the installation instructions. Now that R is installed, you need to download and install RStudio. 2.2 RStudio installation Go to www.rstudio.com and click on the Download RStudio button. Click on Download RStudio Desktop. Click on the version recommended for your system, or the latest Mac version, save the .dmg file on your computer, double-click it to open, and then drag and drop it to your applications folder. 2.3 RStudio and R Is a developer environment for coding, data management, and version control. Multi-pane structure Script editor Console Environment and history Files, plots, packages and help 2.4 Working in RStudio 2.4.1 Script Editor Allows the user to create multi-line code. It is here that you will develop your code and send it to the console. You will save your scripts as appropriately titled .r files. To create a new R script you can either go to File -&gt; New -&gt; R Script, or click on the icon with the + sign and select R Script, or simply press Ctrl+Shift+N. Make sure to save the script. 2.4.2 Console The console is where you can type commands and see output. &gt; is the R Prompt Symbol: You should see the R prompt symbol in your console. If you dont see the prompt, you cannot execute code. + is the R Prompt Symbol meaning you have unfinished code from the previous line. This often occurs if you have an open (unmatched) parentheses or a multiline input. Pressing the ESC will return the &gt; symbol to your console. 2.4.3 Files tab The files tab shows the directory structure and allows GUI manipulation of directories. 2.4.4 Plots tab The plots tab will show all your figures and it is possible to scroll through multiple plots windows. 2.4.5 Packages tab Provides a list of installed packages and a mechanism to load new ones. Here, you can install packages here or using the command line (in the console). # In the console type: install.packages(&quot;package name in quotes&quot;) # Example: install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) For some packages you will see that dependencies are installed when the desired package is installed. These are the packages that the installed package needs in order to run some or all of the functions. 2.4.6 Help tab This tab will be automatically selected whenever you run help code in the Console. 2.4.7 History tab The history tab keeps a record of all previous commands. This can be useful when testing and running processes. To use archived code here, select all and click on the To Source icon, a window on the left will open with the list of commands. 2.4.8 Environment tab Displays data, their classes, and dimensions in your workspace. 2.5 Change my .Rprofile site .Rprofile files are user-controllable files to set options and environment variables. .Rprofile files can be either at the user or project level. User-level .Rprofile files live in the base of the users home directory, and project-level .Rprofile files live in the base of the project directory. R will source only one .Rprofile file. So if you have both a project-specific .Rprofile file and a user .Rprofile file that you want to use, you explicitly source the user-level .Rprofile at the top of your project-level .Rprofile with source(~/.Rprofile). One easy way to edit your .Rprofile file is to use the usethis::edit_r_profile() function from within an R session. You can specify whether you want to edit the user or project level .Rprofile. usethis::edit_r_profile 2.6 Useful RStudio shortcuts Execute code [Ctrl+Alt+R] or [Ctrl+Enter] Ctrl+Enter is used when executing the code line by line.

Divide s by three, then add 33, then take that sum to the 0.5 power 6.3 Dealing with missing values In R, missing values are represented by NA. Undefined values (like dividing by zero) are represented by NaN, not a number. Often missing values are represented with numbers: -1, 99, -9999, etc. This is obviously a problem and should be avoided. You will likely need to use indexing prior using arithmetic operations to replace these values. The is.na function and the na.rm argument: Sometimes we do not know whether there are missing values in our data. We can use the is.na function to test for missing values: # is.na tests for missing values dat.1 &lt;- c(-1,NA,1,1,-1) is.na(dat.1) which(is.na(dat.1)) We can use the logical na.rm argument to remove missing values from our data prior to executing the funciton: dat.1 &lt;- c(-1,NA,1,1,-1) mean(dat.1) mean(dat.1, na.rm = T) Sometimes we code no data as -1 and that can really screw things up. R does not know that -1 means no data. However we can replace the -1 with NA. There are many ways to do this, but here is a simple way. # In this example, -1 is coded as a missing data field.

Can you get a + to occur on your console? 2. How many different ways can you create a vector labled q containing two 3s and four 5s? Try some! 3. Assign a vector of four elements: 3,7,9 and 2 to w. 4. Assign the third element of w to s, where s is equal to 6. 5. What is the length of a sequence that starts at 1.1, ends at 9.2, and has increments of 0.894? 6. What is the 3rd value of the sequence you created? 7. Use the summary function on the sequence object you created, what is returned? 7.2 Logical operators Symbol Operation &lt; less than &gt; greater than &lt;= less than or equal to &gt;= greater than or equal to == exactly equal to Logical operators are useful in indexing and subsetting data classes.

We will learn about other ways to handle repetitive operations, but loops are still widely used. Structure of loops: for (i in 1:5) # Run the loop by single integers { # start loop # run recursive calculation here } # end loop for (i in 1:5) { print(i) } n &lt;- 4 for(i in 1:n) { print(&quot;Hello World&quot;) } n &lt;- 8 n.vect &lt;- c() for(i in 1:n) { n.vect[i] &lt;- i + 2 print(n.vect) } Practice # Create a vector of recursive values # Use a loop to calculate: # 1/2 + 2/3 + 3/4 + 4/5 8.2 If, else, and ifelse If statements are useful if we want R to do something based on our logical question. a &lt;- 7 if (a == 7) print(&quot;a is 7&quot;) If the condition is not met, nothing will print to the console a &lt;- 7 if (a == 5) print(&quot;a is 7&quot;) The same approach works if we want to use not logical. a &lt;- 7 if (a != 5) print(&quot;a is not 5&quot;) Using if and else together allows you to do one thing if the condition is true and something else if the condition is false. a &lt;- 7 if (a == 7) print(&quot;a is 7&quot;) else print(&quot;a is not 7&quot;) a &lt;- 8 if (a == 7) print(&quot;a is 7&quot;) else print(&quot;a is not 7&quot;) The if and else function only can assess one element at a time.
